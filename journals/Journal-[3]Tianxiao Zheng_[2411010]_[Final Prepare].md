# **Overview of Project Progress**
#### **Current Stage**
  Hi there! We almost finish the preparation stage of developing. Now I am organize all the resources to make it readable and organized in Github. I am going to make 3 categories in the Github which includes Narrative, Characters, and BGM. If our team member or the professor want to check the progress of the project, besides the comment of every github push, they can go to "Member Contribution" to see what have the group members done. ALso, weekly journal is a great place to see what have we done this week, with the reflection of one of our group members. Other irrevenant folder would be deleted to make the whole thing nice and clean.

#### **What we have done this week**

  1. Finish the script for different endings
  2. Create some of the character's image by AI tool.(we aim for create all of them this week) [Updated, we have done!]
  3. Try and test the software to create the game(We want to find one that allows us work together)
  4. We have found all the BGM needed

#### **What problems we have met this week**

  1. Translation of the script need to be done ASAP
  2. Developing Software is not decided yet. Well we sort of decided but have not try out how do we work together on a same project.
  3. We have an essay due this week. Everyone is busy in preparing that.


  # **Personal reflection**
  We have done a great work in past 3 weeks. Charles has revised and approved all the endings. Beverly is working hard on the translation part. Since our game is mostly based on the plots, we have to make the scripts easy to understand for everyone.
  Sylvia helped us generated LOTS of character images. They are not only handsome/beautiful, but also fit well with the cyberpunk element/setting. To be more specific, Charles mentioned there is a challenging part that we have to keep the consistency of the artistic style in first week journal. We did a lot of discussion in the group chat and worked together to solve the problem. Now all the characters look like from a same game. 
  As I am organizing all the resources, I found out that there are some of the cyberpunk terms needed to be explain to the audience. I decided to put it on the "Next step" in the following. For this week, we still have lots of work to do but I believe everything is on the right track. However, as the end of the term is approaching, everyone becomes busy. We have not started the most difficult part of this project, which is coding, or making the game. 


  # **Next steps**
  1. We have to catch up in coding the game out. I think most of us are not an expert of coding. The good news is that the developing software seems to be "user-friendly". But still, we have to start it now.
  2. More explanation needed in the scripts. For example, we need a basic explanation of the place/different gangs, or special terms under the setting of Cyberpunk.
