# **Overview of project progress**
#### **current stage**
   Hello, dear development team members! The relaxing Reading Week is over, and this week we will continue to immerse ourselves in the exciting development process. With the update to version 2.0, we are constantly improving and enriching the content of the game, which is really cool! And IT JUST WORKS! Let's continue to learn about it by following this development Journal.
   
   PS: To ensure that everyone remembers to update the development log, the update schedule is once again placed below, so please check it carefullyï¼š

#### **Recent work**

As of November 6th, all the game's plot has been written, and some of it still needs to be proofread and revised, but only a very small part. Our development team members have created multiple, very different endings for the game based on their own ideas, and have enriched the game's narrative again on top of the original main storyline that has already been created. In the main storyline completed last week, our protagonist is facing a critical moment of choice at the AfterLife bar, so our branching stories are expansions on the choices made. Of course, these stories must also be fully consistent with the world view set under Cyberpunk 2077, which is also a part that we need to work hard to check and improve: we must ensure the player's immersion in the game. At the same time, the translation and calibration of the game text is also underway. Due to the game's protagonist's choice of gender, we need to prepare two sets of texts, with minor changes to the characters' lines depending on the gender the player chooses. As for the translation part, we, as developers whose first language is Chinese, still wrote in Chinese in the face of such a huge amount of writing. And after all the plots are completed, we will ensure that all the plot translations are accurate.

#### **Team contribution**
Thanks to Beverly for completing the calibration of the female protagonist's script on time during her vacation in the UK. This week she will be greeted with more complex and tricky translation work, so I hope she is prepared XD. The rest of the team members have completed the writing of their respective plots on time, which is really exciting, and we can't wait to move on to the next development stage.

# **Personal reflection**
#### **Positive aspects**
The writing went very well, and everyone was very careful to make sure that their story fit into the cyberpunk world view. There was a lot of communication between the teams about this.

#### **Unsuccessful aspects**
The challenges were obviously more difficult for us. Compared to the simple scripting part, none of us had any experience in developing long-running games. Therefore, no matter how simple the development engine is, it is a daunting challenge for us. We have to spend a lot of time learning and familiarizing ourselves with the development software. Secondly, the character art, scene art and other art assets have not been finalized, and the music required in the game must also be finalized next week.

# **Overall impression of the project** 
#### **Current opinion**
My personal overall impression of the project is that although it is a short text-based game, it requires a lot of work and a high degree of cooperation and communication among the team members. However, since everyone's living habits are not the same, it is difficult for us to focus on the things we are currently doing and the difficulties we are encountering. In addition, since everyone's aesthetics are different, it is somewhat difficult to achieve unity in terms of the art style.

#### **Future direction expectations**
This project is clearly moving in a good direction, and despite the many challenges that lie ahead, I still think we can make the game we have in mind. Of course, the game has not yet been created using the engine, and as development continues, I'm afraid that content cuts are inevitable. I hope everyone is prepared for this.

# **Next steps**
Now that weekly meetings have been scheduled, I hope that team members will not only start sharing content on the day of the meeting, but will actively communicate with others throughout the week. Constant interaction is the key to our success.
