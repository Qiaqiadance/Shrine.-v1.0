# **Overview of project progress**
#### **current stage**
  Hello, dear development team members. Through this week's efforts, we finally ushered in the most anticipated part of the game development and production. Accompanied by a series of preparatory work, including but not limited to the improvement and adjustment of the plot; Character image production; With the selection of background music, we finally ushered in the most important and difficult part of the entire game, that is, the development of the game. All the movements, changes, and progress can be seen through all the contributions made so far. Then, let's follow this journal to learn more about the current situation.

#### **Recent work**

As of November 20, we have completed the integration and adjustment of all main lines and three sub-stories. In order to ensure that the story is more complete and smooth, and that all the actions of the main characters fit the background of the people, we have read and proofread all the stories uniformly. In addition, as mentioned in the previous journal, since all members of our development team speak Chinese as their mother tongue, we use Chinese in the creation of the story. At present, we have translated all the plot content into English and proofread it. With the help of AI, we also selected and produced animation images of all the protagonists and NPCS as well as their expressions. We are well aware of the impact and importance of background music on the game, so we have completed the selection of different background music for all the branches. At present, we have started to use the game production program for the development and production of games. Since it wasn't possible for multiple people to work at the same time, we chose to build parts of the game in batches. This week, we finished the main story of the game. This week we tried several software for making games, including "Orange Light" from China, and the software recommended by the professor. In the process of trying it out, we found that what we got was not ideal, so in the end we chose to use "renpy" for our game production. renpy is the most widely used word adventure game engine on the market today. We downloaded the converter that has been made by the developers and is open source. The converter is capable of converting Excel tables into rpy script files in the renpy engine. This way of development can avoid a lot of programming, but the disadvantage is that the customizable operation is too low, and there are often bugs. In addition, script files need to be filled in manually during the development process, which increases the production cost. As a result, the flow of the game and the finished product may inevitably see some cuts in the story. This week, all the development and production of the main story have been completed according to the original plan of our team.

#### **Team contribution**
We would like to thank Beverly for translating all the stories and all the school teams in the end. There is also Zishuo's production of all the characters and different expressions. The most important thing is the consistent cooperation of all members and the timely revision of all work contents. Most of all, thanks to Charles for all his research and attempts to develop software.

# **Personal reflection**
#### **Positive aspects**
All the preparation before the development and production of the game was done efficiently. Everyone was highly cooperative in the production process and had excellent communication and coordination skills. All the parts have been completed on time according to our schedule.

#### **Unsuccessful aspects**
The most difficult problem we face at the moment is also the most important part of our production -- the development of the game. We tried almost all the production engines, but most of them were not satisfactory. Moreover, the development and production process of the game is very difficult and tedious, and there are often some bugs. In the process of making AI portraits, it is difficult to ensure that all the characters draw the same style. There are also difficulties in sizing all the figures.

# **Overall impression of the project** 
#### **Current opinion**
Through the production of such a game, I feel the importance of communication. Due to the difference in free time, there are all kinds of problems that people will encounter when making games. Being able to have a good communication skill is the most important point to better develop the whole group task. I also learned how difficult it is to make games. Behind every good game is a team of developers who work very hard.

#### **Future direction expectations**
At the moment we are moving in a good direction. We had different problems in the development and production of the game, big and small, but we solved them all. In the next game production, there will be a variety of such problems, I hope everyone can still maintain the current team spirit.

# **Next steps**
In the next meeting, we will allocate the development time of the three sub-games according to the story flow. And after the completion of the game production, we will start another key point of the game production - game point running test.
