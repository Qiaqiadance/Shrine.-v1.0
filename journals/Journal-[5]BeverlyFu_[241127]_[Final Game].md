### Project Progress Overview

#### **Current Stage**

In this final week of development, our team has moved into the last and most critical phase of the game production process. With clear division of tasks and well-coordinated teamwork, we have made significant progress. Under Charles’ excellent leadership, each member focused on their respective sections while ensuring the overall flow and consistency of the game. Next week, we will showcase and run the completed game in class, accompanied by a presentation detailing our development process.

### **Recent Work**

- **Team Leadership and Software Setup:**
  Charles took the lead in figuring out Ren'Py, an Excel-compatible software tool for game development. This software is intuitive and allows us to generate a simple text-based dialogue game by inputting dialogues, characters, images, and English text into an Excel sheet. Charles spent considerable time exploring its functionalities and hosted a detailed meeting to guide the team through the setup process. During this session, he patiently walked us through running the code step by step and made sure everyone successfully downloaded and understood the necessary files.

- **Task Distribution:**
  Each team member resumed work on their original sections:

  - **Main Storyline:** Charles and I collaborated to complete and refine the main story elements, ensuring narrative consistency and coherence.
  - **Sub-Stories:** Sylvia, Maria, and Riddle focused on their respective sub-story branches, integrating them seamlessly into the overall game framework.

- **Progress Updates:**
  As of this week, all parts of the game have been designed and implemented into the software. Each storyline—including the main and sub-branches—has been tested for functionality within the framework to minimize potential errors during the final testing phase.

### **Team Contributions**

- **Beverly (Me):** Worked closely with Charles on the main storyline, ensuring its seamless integration into the game.
- **Sylvia, Maria, Riddle:** Focused on developing and implementing their individual sub-story branches, maintaining narrative quality and technical precision.
- **Charles:** In addition to leading the Ren'Py setup and guiding the team, Charles handled the final integration work. Since our team members use different operating systems (Windows and Mac), online file sharing wasn't feasible. Charles consolidated all completed sections—main storyline and sub-stories—into a single cohesive game.
- **Entire Team:** Maintained excellent communication and collaboration throughout the process.

### **Personal Reflection**

#### **Positive Aspects**

- The team showed incredible dedication and efficiency during this critical phase, completing all tasks as planned.
- Charles’ leadership and guidance were invaluable, ensuring a smooth and coordinated workflow.
- Each member’s commitment to their respective roles contributed significantly to the project’s success.

#### **Challenges Encountered**

- The initial setup of Ren'Py was time-consuming and required extensive troubleshooting, but Charles’ meticulous guidance helped us overcome these obstacles.
- Ensuring that all branches flowed cohesively into the game’s framework demanded careful review and adjustments.

#### **Overall Impression**

This final week emphasized the importance of clear leadership and teamwork. I deeply appreciate the collaborative spirit and effort everyone put into this project. It was both challenging and rewarding to see our vision come to life.

### **Future Expectations and Next Steps**

#### **Future Directions**

As we wrap up this project, I hope the lessons learned in communication, leadership, and adaptability will serve as a foundation for future endeavors.

#### **Immediate Next Steps**

1. Conduct a comprehensive **final playtesting phase** to identify and resolve any remaining bugs or inconsistencies.
2. Prepare a presentation or demo of the completed game to showcase the team’s work and achievements.
3. Reflect on the entire project process to gather insights for potential future projects.

Next week’s class will mark the culmination of our efforts as we present and run the game. I am incredibly proud of what we’ve accomplished as a team. Thank you to everyone for their hard work and dedication!
