This week, our team members were all devoted to the script improvement work. The atmosphere of the whole team was tense and full of motivation. Everyone focused on their respective tasks to ensure that the script of the project could achieve high-quality completion within the specified time. Based on the main plot of the male protagonist written by Charles, I was responsible for adjusting this main plot and changing the gender of the protagonist to a female to enrich the diversity of the plot.

In this process, I deeply considered the impact of gender conversion on the expression of the story. In addition to making subtle adjustments in the language expression, I also modified the action details and the interaction with NPCs to better fit the personality characteristics and background settings of the female characters. I hope that through these adjustments, players can still feel the continuity of the plot and the unique charm of the characters when the characters are of different genders.

At present, our scripts are all written in Chinese. According to the project requirements, I will translate the entire script into English by next Thursday. This is not just a simple text translation, but also requires consideration of the delicate expression of the language and the natural fluency in line with the English context. This is a huge challenge for me because it is necessary to ensure that the emotional expression and cultural background can be conveyed to the players in both languages. I will go all out to complete a high-quality English script to ensure that our game can get a better user experience in a multilingual environment.
