This week, our team further advanced the development of the game based on the completion of the complete script last week. I took on the heavy translation task of translating the Chinese script into authentic English that conforms to the style of comic games. This is not just a simple text translation, but also requires examining the fluency of the language, the coherence of the plot, and the grasp of the unique tone and narrative style of comic games in the process. In order to ensure that the plot can be better accepted by the target audience, I also adjusted some expressions in combination with the specific plot during the translation to make it more suitable for the player experience in the English cultural background.

At the same time, other team members are also busy finalizing the final image design of all characters. The appearance, costumes and details of each character have been carefully discussed and modified to ensure the overall consistency of the story setting and game style. The finalization of the character image has laid a solid foundation for the subsequent production of the game.

With the successful completion of the script and character design work, our team's preliminary preparations have been fully completed. Next, we will officially enter the game production stage and start using software to transform our ideas into an operational game form. This stage will be the core of our project and the most challenging part, but I believe that through teamwork, we will be able to overcome difficulties and complete this creative work.
