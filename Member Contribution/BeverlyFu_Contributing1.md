This is the first week of game design, and our team has completed the initial framework of the project. Charles was responsible for building the core architecture of the game, which laid a solid foundation for the project. I actively participated in the process and provided some suggestions for task allocation that can improve team collaboration efficiency.
Meanwhile, Sylvia used her proficiency in AI generation technology to design the visual image of the protagonist for the game. I provided constructive feedback in this process to ensure that the image of the protagonist fits the game theme and narrative background we set. My suggestions mainly focused on the character's visual style, personality expression, and integration with the game background setting, which played an important role in the improvement of the final design.
Looking forward to the next few weeks, I plan to make more in-depth contributions to the game. I look forward to our final presentation of a high-quality and engaging game.
