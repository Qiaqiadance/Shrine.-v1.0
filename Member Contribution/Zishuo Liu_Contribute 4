## Development Update: Challenges with Orange Light Software ##

This week, we faced some unexpected challenges during development. Initially, our plan was to use a Chinese software platform called **Orange Light** ("橙光") to develop our Galgame project. However, after conducting multiple tests, we found that the software is not well-suited to accommodate our design requirements, leading to significant compatibility issues.

### Next Steps
- Explore alternative software or platforms better aligned with our design goals.
- Reassess current project scope to adapt to new development tools if necessary.
- Collaborate with the team to identify workarounds or integrations for existing tools.

### Lessons Learned
- Thoroughly test software compatibility with project designs early in the planning phase.
- Maintain flexibility in tool selection to minimize development bottlenecks.
